        <img src="images/file-structure.png" id="right-img">
        <p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>It was easy creating the file structure once I got the hang of it, but I had soem difficulty creating index.html files and making them work right.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure that I made:</p>
        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        <div class="code">
          <pre>
  // initialize the game board
  // set up two players, each with a set of pieces
  // while the game is not over:
      // display the current state of the board
      // ask the current player for their move
      // if the move is valid:
          // execute the move on the board
          // check for any captures
          // check for a win condition
          // switch to the next player
      // else:
          // ask the player to make another move
  // end while
  // display the winner or declare a draw
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="linkbox">
            <a class="homelink" href="../index.html">&lt;&lt; Back home</a>
        </div>
      </main>
    </body>
