                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>The sorted name was easy because I already knew how to do it. Converting to an array seems a bit like a dirty trick, but okay. Shuffling the name was more of a challenge. I'd never done that before (that I remember). I definitely fooled around a good bit to get the CSS to place the name over my image. It helped to turn borders on for that elements so I could position it properly. There are still long names that break the formatting, but it's okay for now -- a balance of simple coding and interesting results.</p>
                <p>I redid the CSS since we didn't have flexbox when I originally created this.</p>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>I'm happy with the output and wanted to type in all of my friends names to see the ridiculous anagrams. Here is the program execution:</p>
                <div>
                <input type="text" id="user-name"><br>
                <button id="submit">Submit</button>

                <div class="linkbox">
                    <a class="homelink" href="../index.html">&lt;&lt; Back home</a>
                    <a class="sourcelink" href="js/lab.js" target="source">JavaScript Source &gt;&gt;</a>
