                Hi, I'm Alex Lim, an aspiring student taking my first steps into the exciting world of art 
                and technology. While I'm relatively new to this journey, I'm filled with enthusiasm and a
                strong desire to learn. I believe that every challenge is an opportunity for growth, and I'm eager to explore the creative and technical aspects of this field.
